## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the General's head, experiencing the journey from the shipwreck to the crate in Rotterdam.
- Create a subplot where a bureaucrat from the capital arrives, intent on cataloging the head, and is slowly driven mad by the town's passive resistance.
- Draft a 'found document'—a series of increasingly desperate memos from the tourism ministry about leveraging the 'Head Affair' for a failed promotional campaign.
- Write a scene where the townspeople stage a surreal, silent play for the head, each acting out their interpretation of colonial history.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Paperwork Simulator' that generates endless, slightly absurd bureaucratic forms (like B-7) in response to user-input historical 'problems'.
- Create an interactive map tracing the head's fictional journey via postmarks, with each location triggering a micro-story about failed states, lost histories, and global trade.
